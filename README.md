# Project1-Cardiovascular-Disease-Prediction-

 Heart disease, also known as cardiovascular disease, is one of the most serious illnesses in both India and the rest of the globe. According to estimates, cardiac illnesses account for 28.1% of fatalities. More than 17.6 million deaths globally in 2016 were attributed to cardiovascular conditions. The goal of this project is to develop a reliable machine learning model that can predict the likelihood of a person having cardiovascular disease using a given dataset containing various medical and lifestyle attributes.
